## Raspberry Pi
These projects center around turning a Raspberry Pi into a home file server. Cloud Pi is a complete solution. Beastie Pi and WeeNAS are unmaintained.
* [Beastie Pi](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/BeastiePi/wiki) -- Tips and tricks for running FreeBSD on Raspberry Pi hardware.
* [Cloud Pi](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi) -- Ansible install of NextCloud and HomeAssistant Docker containers on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 running Raspberry Pi OS (Buster).
* [WeeNAS](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/WeeNAS) -- Web-based administration with REST API for a Raspberry Pi 3 running FreeBSD 12 and Samba. Turns a old Pi and a flash drive into a cheap and totally unreliable NAS.

## Arduino
* [Nano33BLESense](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/Nano33BLESense) -- Arduino sketches for reading sensor data from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and making the readings available as Bluetooth characteristics.

## ESP8266
* [b64](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/b64) -- Base64 encoding and decoding C library with Arduino examples.
* [mqttbaby](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/mqttbaby) -- Use a cheap 8266 microcontroller to publish MQTT messages for home automation projects. 

## JavaScript (Node.js)
* [Daylight](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/daylight) -- Sunrise, sunset, and total daylight hours output in CSV format.
* [irc2Frotz](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/irc2Frotz) -- Connect the Interactive Fiction engine, Frotz, to IRC for multi-player adventures.
* [ircFrankie](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/ircFrankie) -- A simple IRC bot in JavaScript for educational and entertainment purposes.
* [mqttServiceCheck](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/mqttServiceCheck) -- Monitor network services in Home Assistant via MQTT integration.
* [pwHelper](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/pwHelper) -- Reset forgotten FreeBSD passwords if you know the secret phrase.

## HTML / JavaScript
* [htmlGauges](./htmlGauges) -- Analog looking gauges drawn on HTML5 canvases.
* [SpaceTruckin](./SpaceTruckin) -- A Solar System trading game in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript for educational purposes.
* [tzText](./tzText) -- Time zone names in HTML/JavaScript to use in selection lists.

## REST API Examples 
* [SolarEdgeAPI](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/SolarEdgeAPI) -- Read SolarEdge inverter data using API calls to monitoring site. Examples in HTML/JavaScript, Node.js, Python, and Linux shell.
